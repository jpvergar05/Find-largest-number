Overview
This program demonstrates how to create and manipulate a singly linked list in C++. The program allows the user to input a list of integers, find the largest value in the list, and print the list's contents.

Features
Dynamically creates a singly linked list based on user input.
Uses the IntNode class to manage list nodes and links.
Finds the largest integer in the list using a custom findLargest function.
Prints the list contents after finding the largest value.
How It Works
The user specifies the number of items in the list and provides integer values for each node.
The program builds the list dynamically using the IntNode class, connecting nodes in sequence.
The findLargest function processes the list to find the largest integer.
The program displays:
The largest value found in the list.
The full list of integers.
